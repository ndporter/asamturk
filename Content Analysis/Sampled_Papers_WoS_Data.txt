AB By 2025, when most of today's psychology undergraduates will be in their
   mid-30s, more than 5 billion people on our planet will be using
   ultra-broadband, sensor-rich smartphones far beyond the abilities of
   today's iPhones, Androids, and Blackberries. Although smartphones were
   not designed for psychological research, they can collect vast amounts
   of ecologically valid data, easily and quickly, from large global
   samples. If participants download the right "psych apps," smartphones
   can record where they are, what they are doing, and what they can see
   and hear and can run interactive surveys, tests, and experiments through
   touch screens and wireless connections to nearby screens, headsets,
   biosensors, and other peripherals. This article reviews previous
   behavioral research using mobile electronic devices, outlines what
   smartphones can do now and will be able to do in the near future,
   explains how a smartphone study could work practically given current
   technology (e.g., in studying ovulatory cycle effects on women's
   sexuality), discusses some limitations and challenges of smartphone
   research, and compares smartphones to other research methods. Smartphone
   research will require new skills in app development and data analysis
   and will raise tough new ethical issues, but smartphones could transform
   psychology even more profoundly than PCs and brain imaging did.

   words (nouns, verbs, and adjectives). For data collection, this
   megastudy used the Web-based crowdsourcing technology offered by the
   Amazon Mechanical Turk. Our data indicate that the ratings collected in
   this way are as valid and reliable as those collected in laboratory
   conditions (the correlation between our ratings and those collected in
   the lab from U. S. students reached .93 for a subsample of 2,500
   monosyllabic words). We also show that our AoA ratings explain a
   substantial percentage of the variance in the lexical-decision data of
   the English Lexicon Project, over and above the effects of log
   frequency, word length, and similarity to other words. This is true not
   only for the lemmas used in our rating study, but also for their
   inflected forms. We further discuss the relationships of AoA with other
   predictors of word recognition and illustrate the utility of AoA ratings
   for research on vocabulary growth.

AB While previous studies have correlated the Dark Triad traits (i.e.,
   narcissism, psychopathy, and Machiavellianism) with a preference for
   short-term relationships, little research has addressed possible
   correlations with short-term relationship sub-types. In this online
   study using Amazon's Mechanical Turk system (N = 210) we investigated
   the manner in which scores on the Dark Triad relate to the selection of
   different mating environments using a budget-allocation task. Overall,
   the Dark Triad were positively correlated with preferences for
   short-term relationships and negatively correlated with preferences for
   a long-term relationship. Specifically, narcissism was uniquely
   correlated with preferences for one-night stands and
   friends-with-benefits and psychopathy was uniquely correlated with
   preferences for booty-call relationships. Both narcissism and
   psychopathy were negatively correlated with preferences for serious
   romantic relationships. In mediation analyses, psychopathy partially
   mediated the sex difference in preferences for booty-call relationships
   and narcissism partially mediated the sex difference in preferences for
   one-night stands. In addition, the sex difference in preference for
   serious romantic relationships was partially mediated by both narcissism
   and psychopathy. It appears the Dark Triad traits facilitate the
   adoption of specific mating environments providing fit with people's
   personality traits. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Technology is becoming deeply interwoven into the fabric of society. The
   Internet has become a central source of information for many people when
   making day-to-day decisions. Here, we present a method to mine the vast
   data Internet users create when searching for information online, to
   identify topics of interest before stock market moves. In an analysis of
   historic data from 2004 until 2012, we draw on records from the search
   engine Google and online encyclopedia Wikipedia as well as judgments
   from the service Amazon Mechanical Turk. We find evidence of links
   between Internet searches relating to politics or business and
   subsequent stock market moves. In particular, we find that an increase
   in search volume for these topics tends to precede stock market falls.
   We suggest that extensions of these analyses could offer insight into
   large-scale information flow before a range of real-world events.

AB Considered a positive body image measure, the 13-item Body Appreciation
   Scale (BAS; Avalos, Tylka, & Wood-Barcalow, 2005) assesses individuals'
   acceptance of, favorable opinions toward, and respect for their bodies.
   While the BAS has accrued psychometric support, we improved it by
   rewording certain BAS items (to eliminate sex-specific versions and body
   dissatisfaction-based language) and developing additional items based on
   positive body image research. In three studies, we examined the
   reworded, newly developed, and retained items to determine their
   psychometric properties among college and online community (Amazon
   Mechanical Turk) samples of 820 women and 767 men. After exploratory
   factor analysis, we retained 10 items (five original BAS items).
   Confirmatory factor analysis upheld the BAS-2's unidimensionality and
   invariance across sex and sample type. Its internal consistency,
   test-retest reliability, and construct (convergent, incremental, and
   discriminant) validity were supported. The BAS-2 is a psychometrically
   sound positive body image measure applicable for research and clinical

AB People and societies seek to combat harmful events. However, because
   resources are limited, every wrong righted leaves another wrong left
   unchecked. Responses must therefore be calibrated to the magnitude of
   the harm. One underappreciated factor that affects this calibration may
   be people's oversensitivity to intent. Across a series of studies,
   people saw intended harms as worse than unintended harms, even though
   the two harms were identical. This harm-magnification effect occurred
   for both subjective and monetary estimates of harm, and it remained when
   participants were given incentives to be accurate. The effect was fully
   mediated by blame motivation. People may therefore focus on intentional
   harms to the neglect of unintentional (but equally damaging) harms.

AB We hypothesized that individuals may differ in the dispositional
   tendency to have positive vs. negative attitudes, a trait termed the
   dispositional attitude. Across 4 studies, we developed a 16-item
   Dispositional Attitude Measure (DAM) and investigated its internal
   consistency, test-retest reliability, factor structure, convergent
   validity, discriminant validity, and predictive validity. DAM scores
   were (a) positively correlated with positive affect traits,
   curiosity-related traits, and individual preexisting attitudes; (b)
   negatively correlated with negative affect traits; and (c) uncorrelated
   with theoretically unrelated traits. Dispositional attitudes also
   significantly predicted the valence of novel attitudes while controlling
   for theoretically relevant traits (such as the Big 5 and optimism). The
   dispositional attitude construct represents a new perspective in which
   attitudes are not simply a function of the properties of the stimuli
   under consideration, but are also a function of the properties of the
   evaluator. We discuss the intriguing implications of dispositional
   attitudes for many areas of research, including attitude formation,
   persuasion, and behavior prediction.

AB Recent research finds that people respond more generously to individual
   victims described in detail than to equivalent statistical victims
   described in general terms. We propose that this "identified victim
   effect" is one manifestation of a more general phenomenon: a positive
   influence of tangible information on generosity. In three experiments,
   we find evidence for an "identified intervention effect"; providing
   tangible details about a charity's interventions significantly increases
   donations to that charity. Although previous work described sympathy as
   the primary mediator between tangible information and giving, current
   mediational analyses show that the influence of tangible details can
   operate through donors' perception that their contribution will have
   impact. Taken together with past work, the results suggest that tangible
   information of many types promotes generosity and can do so either via
   sympathy or via perceived impact. The ability of tangible information to
   increase impact points to new ways for charities to encourage
   generosity. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Brain scans have frequently been credited with uniquely seductive and
   persuasive qualities, leading to claims that fMRI research receives a
   disproportionate share of public attention and funding. It has been
   suggested that functional brain images are fascinating because they
   contradict dualist beliefs regarding the relationship between the body
   and the mind. Although previous research has indicated that brain images
   can increase judgments of an article's scientific reasoning, the
   hypotheses that brain scans make research appear more interesting,
   surprising, or worthy of funding have not been tested. Neither has the
   relation between the allure of brain imaging and dualism. In the
   following three studies, laypersons rated both fictional research
   descriptions and real science news articles accompanied by brain scans,
   bar charts, or photographs. Across 988 participants, we found little
   evidence of neuroimaging ' s seductive allure or of its relation to
   self- professed dualistic beliefs. These results, taken together with
   other recent null findings, suggest that brain images are less powerful

AB Intercultural tensions and conflicts are inevitable in the global

   disharmony-indirect experience of intercultural tensions and conflicts
   in individuals' immediate social environment-and demonstrates how it
   undermines creative thinking in tasks that draw on knowledge from
   multiple cultures. Three studies (a network survey and two experiments)
   showed that ambient cultural disharmony decreased individuals'
   effectiveness at connecting ideas from disparate cultures. Beliefs that
   ideas from different cultures are incompatible mediated the relationship
   between ambient cultural disharmony and creativity. Alternative
   mechanisms such as negative affect and cognitive disruption were not
   viable mediators. Although ambient cultural disharmony disrupted
   creativity, ambient cultural harmony did not promote creativity. These
   findings have theoretical and practical implications for research in

AB The present research extends prior work by proposing that followers'
   social identification with a group can translate into their relational
   identification with leaders. Study 1 demonstrates experimentally that
   compared to low-identified followers, highly identified followers
   perceive themselves to share relational identity with a leader when that
   leader is representative of their ingroup (but not if that leader is
   representative of an outgroup). Followers' relational identification, in
   turn, influences not only their experience of a personal bond with the
   leader but also perceptions of leader charisma. Study 2 replicates these
   findings in the context of Presidential candidates in the 2012 US
   election and extends them by examining leader prototypicality as a
   further moderating factor. Findings suggest that followers' experience
   of a 'special' and 'personal' bond with leaders arises from their social
   bond within a group that binds them together and provides a framework
   for their mutual relationship. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

AB Psychological researchers have begun to utilize Amazon's Mechanical Turk
   (MTurk) marketplace as a participant pool. Although past work has
   established that MTurk is well suited to examining individual behavior,
   pseudo-dyadic interactions, in which participants falsely believe they
   are interacting with a partner, are a key element of social and
   cognitive psychology. The ability to conduct such interdependent
   research on MTurk would increase the utility of this online population
   for a broad range of psychologists. The present research therefore
   attempts to qualitatively replicate well-established pseudo-dyadic tasks
   on MTurk in order to establish the utility of this platform as a tool
   for researchers. We find that participants do behave as if a partner is
   real, even when doing so incurs a financial cost, and that they are
   sensitive to subtle information about the partner in a minimal-groups
   paradigm, supporting the use of MTurk for pseudo-dyadic research.

   among anxiety sensitivity, experiential avoidance, and perceived stress
   were examined using a large college student sample (N = 4 00) in Study 1
   and were replicated using a large community sample (N = 83 8) in Study
   2. As predicted, experiential avoidance moderated the relationship
   between anxiety sensitivity and perceived stress. Contrary to
   expectations, simple effects in both studies revealed that anxiety
   sensitivity shared a significant positive association with perceived
   stress at low, but not high, levels of experiential avoidance. The
   moderating role of experiential avoidance was found to be robust to the
   effects of general distress. Moreover, anxiety sensitivity and
   experiential avoidance evidenced a differential pattern of relations
   with perceived stress than was evidenced with related negative affective
   states (i.e., anxiety and depression). The present results suggest that
   experiential avoidance appears to be a vulnerability factor of
   particular importance for understanding the phenomenology of perceived
   stress. Conceptual and clinical implications are discussed.

AB Computer and internet based questionnaires have become a standard tool
   in Human-Computer Interaction research and other related fields, such as
   psychology and sociology. Amazon's Mechanical Turk (AMT) service is a
   new method of recruiting participants and conducting certain types of
   experiments. This study compares whether participants recruited through
   AMT give different responses than participants recruited through an
   online forum or recruited directly on a university campus. Moreover, we
   compare whether a study conducted within AMT results in different
   responses compared to a study for which participants are recruited
   through AMT but which is conducted using an external online
   questionnaire service. The results of this study show that there is a
   statistical difference between results obtained from participants
   recruited through AMT compared to the results from the participant
   recruited on campus or through online forums. We do, however, argue that
   this difference is so small that it has no practical consequence. There
   was no significant difference between running the study within AMT
   compared to running it with an online questionnaire service. There was
   no significant difference between results obtained directly from within
   AMT compared to results obtained in the campus and online forum
   condition. This may suggest that AMT is a viable and economical option
   for recruiting participants and for conducting studies as setting up and
   running a study with AMT generally requires less effort and time
   compared to other frequently used methods. We discuss our findings as
   well as limitations of using AMT for empirical studies.

AB Objectives: To automatically identify and cluster clinical trials with
   similar eligibility features.
   Methods: Using the public repository ClinicalTrials.gov as the data
   source, we extracted semantic features from the eligibility criteria
   text of all clinical trials and constructed a trial-feature matrix. We
   calculated the pairwise similarities for all clinical trials based on
   their eligibility features. For all trials, by selecting one trial as
   the center each time, we identified trials whose similarities to the
   central trial were greater than or equal to a predefined threshold and
   constructed center-based clusters. Then we identified unique trial sets
   with distinctive trial membership compositions from center-based
   clusters by disregarding their structural information.
   Results: From the 145,745 clinical trials on ClinicalTrials.gov, we
   extracted 5,508,491 semantic features. Of these, 459,936 were unique and
   160,951 were shared by at least one pair of trials. Crowdsourcing the
   cluster evaluation using Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk), we identified
   the optimal similarity threshold, 0.9. Using this threshold, we
   generated 8806 center-based clusters. Evaluation of a sample of the
   clusters by MTurk resulted in a mean score 4.331 +/- 0.796 on a scale of
   1-5 (5 indicating "strongly agree that the trials in the cluster are
   similar").
   Conclusions: We contribute an automated approach to clustering clinical
   trials with similar eligibility features. This approach can be
   potentially useful for investigating knowledge reuse patterns in
   clinical trial eligibility criteria designs and for improving clinical
   trial recruitment. We also contribute an effective crowdsourcing method
   for evaluating informatics interventions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All

   satisfaction over time. However, counter to hypotheses, living a calling
   was best positioned as an outcome of each of these variables.
   Specifically, living a calling at Time 2 and Time 3 was significantly
   predicted by career commitment, work meaning, and job satisfaction at
   Time 1 and Time 2, respectively. Time 2 living a calling did predict
   Time 3 work career commitment and work meaning, but these effects were

   meat eating to be a scrutinized behavior, remind meat eaters of their
   discomfort, and undermine the effectiveness of these strategies. It was
   therefore hypothesized that exposure to a description of a vegetarian
   would lead omnivores to embrace dissonance-reducing strategies.
   Supporting this hypothesis, participants who read a vignette about a
   vegetarian denied animal mind more than participants who read about a
   gluten-free individual. It was also hypothesized that omnivores would be
   sensitive to individual differences between vegetarians and would
   demonstrate using dissonance-reducing strategies more when the situation
   failed to provide cognitions consonant with eating meat or to reduce
   dissonant cognitions. Four experiments supported this prediction and
   found that authentic vegetarians, vegetarians freely making the decision
   to abandon meat, consistent vegetarians, and anticipating moral reproach
   from vegetarians produced greater endorsement of dissonance-reducing
   strategies than their counterpart conditions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB Spite is an understudied construct that has been virtually ignored
   within the personality, social, and clinical psychology literatures.
   This study introduces a self-report Spitefulness Scale to assess
   individual differences in spitefulness. The scale was initially tested
   on a large sample of 946 college students and cross-validated on a
   national sample of 297 adults. The scale was internally consistent in
   both samples. Factor analysis supported a 1-factor solution for the
   initial pool of 31 items. Item response theory analysis was used to
   identify the best performing of the original 31 items in the university
   sample and reduce the scale to 17 items. Tests of measurement invariance
   indicated that the items functioned similarly across both university and
   national samples, across both men and women, and across both ethnic
   majority and minority groups. Men reported higher levels of spitefulness
   than women, younger people were more spiteful than older people, and
   ethnic minority members reported higher levels of spitefulness than
   ethnic majority members. Across both samples, spitefulness was
   positively associated with aggression, psychopathy, Machiavellianism,
   narcissism, and guilt-free shame, and negatively correlated with
   selfesteem, guilt-proneness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness.
   Ideally, this Spitefulness Scale will be able to predict behavior in
   both laboratory settings (e. g., ultimatum games, aggression paradigms)
   and everyday life, contribute to the diagnosis of personality disorders
   and oppositional defiant disorder, and encourage further study of this
   neglected, often destructive, trait.

AB Background: Research suggests that lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB)
   populations experience higher prevalence of school bullying than
   heterosexuals. Objectives: We examined if (a) verbal versus physical
   bullying were differentially associated with physical health among
   sexual minorities and (b) if sexual identity (i.e., homosexual [i.e.,
   lesbian/gay] vs. bisexual) moderated the association of bullying on
   physical health. Design: LGB adults aged 18 to 66 years (n = 463) were
   recruited online. Participants reported high school experiences of
   verbal and physical bullying and physician-diagnosed health conditions.
   Results: Physical and verbal bullying were related to physical health
   conditions (ps < .01). Physical bullying had a significant negative
   impact on physical health for bisexual persons (p < .001) but not for
   gay/lesbian persons. Conclusions: Experiencing bullying in high school
   was associated with physical health problems in adulthood. Bullying had
   a different relationship with health problems for bisexually identified
   individuals compared to lesbian/gay individuals. Future research should
   strive to disentangle potential differences in the relationship between
   bullying and health within sexual minority groups.

AB Psychopathy is related to parasitic behavior that is both antisocial and
   high-risk. Such individuals are unlikely to consider consequences when
   engaging in selfish financial behavior, even in the face of punishment
   and financial loss. After completing Dark Triad measures (psychopathy,
   Machiavellianism, and narcissism), participants were told that everyone
   could gamble (in a clearly biased game) with the next person's bonus.
   Participants were then randomly assigned to think their bonus was still
   intact or nearly depleted. Participants were then given the option to
   punish the previous participant. Finally, participants were given the
   option to gamble with the next participant's bonus. Wins benefited
   current participants, and losses hurt the next participant. Participants
   were reminded that they could be punished by the next participant and
   lose everything. Results indicated that all three Dark Triad traits
   correlated with attempting one round of gambling. However, only
   individuals high in psychopathy persisted in gambling, leading to
   greater financial loss of the next participant. These findings highlight
   the importance of screening for malevolent traits in the financial
   world, particularly psychopathy. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Differences in political orientation are partly rooted in personality,
   with liberalism predicted by Openness to Experience and conservatism by
   Conscientiousness. Since Openness is positively associated with
   intellectual and creative activities, these may help shape political
   orientation. We examined whether exposure to cultural activities and
   historical knowledge mediates the relationship between personality and
   political orientation. Specifically, we examined the mediational role of
   print exposure (Study 1), film exposure (Study 2), and knowledge of
   American history (Study 3). Studies 1 and 2 found that print and film
   exposure mediated the relationships Openness to Experience and
   Conscientiousness have with political orientation. In Study 3, knowledge
   of American history mediated the relationship between Openness and
   political orientation, but not the association between Conscientiousness
   and political orientation. Exposure to culture, and a corollary of this
   exposure in the form of acquiring knowledge, can therefore partially
   explain the associations between personality and political orientation.

AB Elevation refers to the feeling experienced when a moral act is
   witnessed. The current study sought to illuminate elevation by examining
   conditions under which elevation is amplified. Study 1 demonstrated that
   the character of the recipient of the moral deed moderates the
   relationship between witnessing a moral deed and experiencing elevation.
   Study 2 replicated the first and included a behavioral outcome measure:
   donation behavior. Study 3 considered an additional factor: the immoral
   act. Finally, to ensure the character of the recipient is not the sole
   moderator, Study 4 experimentally tested a second moderating variable
   (i.e. the effort required for completing the moral act). As a whole,
   these four studies consistently support Haidts conceptualization of
   elevation, open the door for a new path of theoretical exploration, and
   introduce a new line of applied research seeking to maximize prosocial
   behavior by exposing people to acts of morality.

AB Information exchange systems, such as BitTorrent, Yahoo Answers, Yelp,
   Amazon Mechanical Turk, differ in many ways, but all share a common
   vulnerability to selfish behavior and free-riding. In this paper, we
   build incentives schemes based on social norms. Social norms prescribe a
   social strategy for the agents in the system to follow and deploy
   reputation schemes to reward or penalize agents depending on whether
   they follow or deviate from the prescribed strategy when selecting
   actions. Because agents in these systems often have only limited
   capability to observe the global system information, e. g. the
   reputation distribution of the agents participating in the system, their
   beliefs about the reputation distribution are heterogeneous and biased.
   Such belief heterogeneity causes a positive fraction of agents to not
   follow the social strategy. In such practical scenarios, the standard
   equilibrium analysis deployed in the economics literature is no longer
   directly applicable and hence, the system design needs to consider these
   differences. To investigate how the system designs need to change, we
   focus on a simple social norm with binary reputation labels but allow
   adjusting the punishment severity through randomization. First, we model
   the belief heterogeneity using a suitable Bayesian belief function.
   Next, we formalize the agents' optimal decision problems and derive in
   which scenarios they follow the prescribed social strategy. Then we
   study how the system state is determined by the agents' strategic
   behavior. We are particularly interested in the robust equilibrium where
   the system state becomes invariant when all agents strategically
   optimize their decisions. By rigorously studying two specific cases
   where agents' belief distribution is constant or is linearly influenced
   by the true reputation distribution, we prove that the optimal
   reputation update rule is to choose the mildest possible punishment.
   This result is further confirmed for more sophisticated belief
   influences in simulations. In conclusion, our proposed design framework
   enables the development of optimal social norms for various deployment
   scenarios with limited observations.

AB Autogynephilia, or paraphilic sexual arousal in a man to the thought or
   image of himself as a woman, manifests in a variety of different
   behaviors and fantasies. We examined the psychometric structure of 22
   items assessing five known types of autogynephilia by subjecting them to
   exploratory factor analysis in a sample of 149 autogynephilic men.
   Results of oblique factor analyses supported the ability to distinguish
   five group factors with suitable items. Results of hierarchical factor
   analyses suggest that the five group factors were strongly underlain by
   a general factor of autogynephilia. Because the general factor accounted
   for a much greater amount of the total variance of the 22 items than did
   the group factors, the types of autogynephilia that a man has seem less
   important than the degree to which he has autogynephilia. However, the
   five types of autogynephilia remain conceptually useful because
   meaningful distinctions were found among them, including differential
   rates of endorsement and differential ability to predict other relevant
   variables like gender dysphoria. Factor-derived scales and subscales
   demonstrated good internal consistency reliabilities, and validity, with
   large differences found between autogynephilic men and heterosexual male
   controls. Future research should attempt to replicate our findings,
   which were mostly exploratory.

AB A central question for models of visual working memory is whether the
   number of objects people can remember depends on object complexity. Some
   influential "slot" models of working memory capacity suggest that people
   always represent 3-4 objects and that only the fidelity with which these
   objects are represented is affected by object complexity. The primary
   evidence supporting this claim is the finding that people can detect
   large changes to complex objects (consistent with remembering at least 4
   individual objects), but that small changes cannot be detected
   (consistent with low-resolution representations). Here we show that
   change detection with large changes greatly overestimates individual
   item capacity when people can use global representations of the display
   to detect such changes. When the ability to use such global ensemble or
   texture representations is reduced, people remember individual
   information about only 1-2 complex objects. This finding challenges
   models that propose people always remember a fixed number of objects,
   regardless of complexity, and supports a more flexible model with an
   important role for spatial ensemble representations.

AB Internet help seeking behaviors are increasingly common. Despite the
   positives associated with technology, cyberchondria, or the process of
   increased anxiety in response to internet medical information seeking,
   is on the rise. The Cyberchondria Severity Scale (CSS) was recently
   developed to provide a valid measure of cyberchondria across multiple
   dimensions. The current study sought to extend previous work on the CSS
   factor structure by examining a bifactor model. Participants (N = 526)
   from a community sample completed the CSS via online crowd sourcing.
   Results revealed that the bifactor model of the CSS provided superior
   fit to the data, suggesting that it is useful to conceptualize the CSS
   as containing a General Cyberchondria factor that is orthogonal to its
   subfactors. Similar to previous work, the CSS Mistrust factor does not
   appear to be necessary to this construct. Finally, results revealed
   unique relations between General and Specific Cyberchondria factors with
   lower-order health anxiety dimensions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   closeness for avoidantly attached people would offset their

   Study 1, amongst a sample of 234 people on Mechanical Turk, avoidant
   attachment related to donating less money to human- and animal-related
   charities, but not a charity that did not foster emotional closeness.
   This relationship was mediated by empathy. In Study 2, amongst a sample
   of 193 college students, avoidantly attached people who believed that
   their emotions were temporarily unchangeable helped as much as people
   low in avoidant attachment. Reducing the potential emotional cost of
   helping increases helping amongst people who are avoidantly attached.

AB Some self-report measures of personality and personality disorders,
   including the widely used Psychopathic Personality Inventory-Revised
   (PPI-R), are lengthy and time-intensive. In recent work, we introduced
   an automated genetic algorithm (GA)-based method for abbreviating
   psychometric measures. In Study 1, we used this approach to generate a
   short (40-item) version of the PPI-R using 3 large-N German student
   samples (total N = 1,590). The abbreviated measure displayed high
   convergent correlations with the original PPI-R, and outperformed an
   alternative measure constructed using a conventional approach. Study 2
   tested the convergent and discriminant validity of this short version in
   a fourth student sample (N = 206) using sensation-seeking and
   sensitivity to reward and punishment scales, again demonstrating similar
   convergent and discriminant validity for the PPI-R-40 compared with the
   full version. In a fifth community sample of North American participants
   acquired using Amazon Mechanical Turk, the PPI-R-40 showed similarly
   high convergent correlations, demonstrating stability across language,
   culture, and data-collection method. Taken together, these studies
   suggest that the GA approach is a viable method for abbreviating
   measures of psychopathy, and perhaps personality measures in general.

AB Objective: Biological explanations of psychopathology can reduce the
   extent to which people with mental disorders are blamed for their
   symptoms but can also yield prognostic pessimism the belief that
   psychiatric conditions are relatively immutable. However, few studies
   have examined whether these effects occur among persons who actually
   have psychiatric symptoms. This study sought to address this question.
   Methods: Adults living in the United States (N=351) were recruited
   online in January and February 2012 and assessed for symptoms of
   generalized anxiety disorder. The participants were randomly assigned to
   two groups: a biological condition, in which participants (N=176) were
   provided a description of generalized anxiety disorder and a biological
   explanation of the etiology of the disorder, and a control condition, in
   which participants (N=175) were provided the same description without
   any explanation of etiology. Dependent measures of treatability,
   duration of symptoms, and responsibility for symptoms were used to gauge
   beliefs regarding the prognosis and personal responsibility of a typical
   person with generalized anxiety disorder. Results: Among participants
   with and without symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder, the
   biological condition was associated with decreased ascriptions of
   personal responsibility for anxiety (p=.02) and expectations of
   increased duration of symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder (p=.01).
   Conclusions: This finding has important social and clinical
   implications, especially because biological conceptualizations of
   psychopathology are increasingly prevalent. By causing prognostic
   pessimism about generalized anxiety disorder, including among those with
   symptoms of the disorder, biological explanations could negatively
   affect treatment seeking and outcomes. Efforts to dispel the link
   between biological explanations and prognostic pessimism are needed.

AB Multiple recent studies report that measures of pathogen avoidance
   (e.g., disgust sensitivity) correlate with political ideology. This
   relationship has been interpreted as suggesting that certain political
   views (specifically, those views that are categorized as socially
   conservative) function to mitigate the pathogen threats posed either by
   intergroup interactions or by departures from traditional societal
   norms, which sometimes evolve culturally for anti-pathogen functions. We
   propose and test the alternative hypothesis that pathogen avoidance
   relates to conservatism indirectly via sexual strategies (e.g.,
   relatively monogamous versus relatively promiscuous). Specifically, we
   argue that individuals who are more invested in avoiding pathogens
   follow a more monogamous mating strategy to mitigate against pathogens
   transmitted during sexual contact, and individuals following a more
   monogamous mating strategy adopt socially conservative political
   ideologies to support their reproductive interests. Results from three
   studies (N's = 819, 238, and 248) using multiple measures of pathogen
   avoidance, sexual strategies, and ideology support this account, with
   sexual strategies fully mediating the relationship between measures of
   pathogen avoidance and conservatism in each study. (C) 2015 Elsevier

AB Online experiments are growing in popularity, and the increasing
   sophistication of Web technology has made it possible to run complex
   behavioral experiments online using only a Web browser. Unlike with
   offline laboratory experiments, however, few tools exist to aid in the
   development of browser-based experiments. This makes the process of
   creating an experiment slow and challenging, particularly for
   researchers who lack a Web development background. This article
   introduces jsPsych, a JavaScript library for the development of
   Web-based experiments. jsPsych formalizes a way of describing
   experiments that is much simpler than writing the entire experiment from
   scratch. jsPsych then executes these descriptions automatically,
   handling the flow from one task to another. The jsPsych library is
   open-source and designed to be expanded by the research community. The
   project is available online at www.jspsych.org.

AB Previous research rarely investigated the role of physical environment
   in counteracting ego-depletion. In the present research, we hypothesized
   that exposure to natural environment counteracts ego-depletion. Three
   experiments were conducted to test this hypothesis. In Experiment 1,
   initially depleted participants who viewed pictures of nature scenes
   showed greater persistence on a subsequent anagram task than those who
   were given a rest period. Experiment 2 expanded upon this finding by
   showing that natural environment enhanced logical reasoning performance
   after ego-depleting task. Experiment 3 adopted a two- (depletion vs.
   no-depletion) -by-two (nature exposure vs. urban exposure) factorial
   design. We found that nature exposure moderated the effect of depletion
   on anagram task performance. Taken together, the present studies offer a
   viable and novel strategy to mitigate the negative impacts of
   ego-depletion.

AB While multimedia and social computing research have used crowdsourcing
   techniques to annotate objects, actions, and scenes in social video
   sites like YouTube, little work has addressed the crowdsourcing of
   personal and social traits in online social video or social media
   content in general. In this paper, we address the problems of (1)
   crowdsourcing the annotation of first impressions of video bloggers
   (vloggers) personal and social traits in conversational YouTube videos,
   and (2) mining the impressions with the goal of modeling the interplay
   of different vlogger facets. First, we design a human annotation task to
   crowdsource impressions of vloggers that extends a tradition of studies
   of personality impressions with the addition of attractiveness and mood
   impressions. Second, we propose a probabilistic framework using Topic
   Models to discover prototypical impressions that are data driven, and
   that combine multiple facets of vloggers. Finally, we address the task
   of automatically predicting topic impressions using nonverbal and verbal
   content extracted from videos and comments. Our study of 442 YouTube
   vlogs and 2,210 annotations collected in Mechanical Turk supports recent
   literature showing the feasibility to crowdsource interpersonal human
   impression with comparable quality to what is reported in social
   psychology research, and provides insights on the interplay among human
   first impressions. We also show that topic models are useful to discover
   meaningful prototypical impressions that can be validated by humans, and
   that different topics can be predicted using different sources of
   information from vloggers' nonverbal and verbal content, as well as
   comments from the audience.

   2010) suggests that psychotherapy clients may place more value on
   nonspecific common factorssuch as a warm and relatable therapistthan on
   the level of empirical support for a particular intervention. The
   present study investigated the possibility that this trend would also
   extend to those who have never received professional psychological help.
   MethodThree hundred and twenty-nine adults from across the United States
   (60.2% female, mean age = 35.92) each rated their attitudes toward
   seeking two varieties of psychotherapy: one emphasizing nonspecific
   common factors, and one emphasizing specific evidence-based therapy
   ingredients.
   ResultsAnalyses revealed a pronounced preference for therapy guided by
   common factors among clients and nonclients alike, even when controlling
   for a host of individual difference variables.
   ConclusionsThese data conceptually replicate Swift and Callahan's
   findings and indicate that potential clients may seek help more readily
   from providers who accentuate the nonspecific aspects of therapy.(C)

AB Research on individual differences in maximizing (versus satisficing)
   has recently proliferated in the Judgment and Decision Making
   literature, and high scores on this construct have been linked to lower
   life satisfaction as well as, in some cases, to worse decision-making
   performance. The current study exported this construct to the
   organizational domain and evaluated the utility of the three most widely
   used measures of maximizing in predicting several criteria of interest
   to organizational researchers: job satisfaction, intentions to quit the
   organization, performance in the job role, and income. Moreover, this
   study used relative weight analyses to determine the relative importance
   of maximizing and two dispositional variables (conscientiousness and
   core self-evaluations) that are traditionally used to predict these
   criteria in the organizational literature. Results indicate that
   relationships between maximizing and these criteria are influenced by
   the way in which maximizing is measured. Yet, regardless of how it is
   measured, maximizing is not a particularly strong predictor of these
   criteria compared to traditional organizational predictors. Limitations
   and future research directions are discussed.

AB A common task for spoken dialog systems (SDS) is to help users select a
   suitable option (e.g., flight, hotel, and restaurant) from the set of
   options available. As the number of options increases, the system must
   have strategies for generating summaries that enable the user to browse
   the option space efficiently and successfully. In the user-model based
   summarize and refine approach (UMSR, Demberg and Moore, 2006), options
   are clustered to maximize utility with respect to a user model, and
   linguistic devices such as discourse cues and adverbials are used to
   highlight the trade-offs among the presented items. In a Wizard-of-Oz
   experiment, we show that the UMSR approach leads to improvements in task
   success, efficiency, and user satisfaction compared to an approach that
   clusters the available options to maximize coverage of the domain
   (Polifroni et al., 2003). In both a laboratory experiment and a
   web-based experimental paradigm employing the Amazon Mechanical Turk
   platform, we show that the discourse cues in UMSR summaries help users
   compare different options and choose between options, even though they
   do not improve verbatim recall. This effect was observed for both
   written and spoken stimuli. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   human. These attributes are materialized also in the Renaissance
   'mammet' or mechanical puppet, an object whose name bears the trace of a
   supposedly lifeless and regressive Islam. Turning to Romeo and Juliet,
   the essay concludes with a consideration of how Shakespeare's play
   deploys the mammet to counter-intuitive, untimely ends: by figuring
   Juliet as a mammet whose mechanical compulsions enable a messianic
   refusal of the old patronymic law, Romeo and Juliet explodes the

   The validity of the scale is established with 3526 participants in five

   construct and criterion-related validity of the measure, and indicate
   that cultural intelligence is a single latent factor reflected in three
   intermediate facets. In support of construct validity the measure is
   modestly related to but distinct from emotional intelligence and
   personality and correlates positively with several indicators of
   multicultural experience. With regard to criterion-related validity, it
   relates as predicted to several dimensions of intercultural
   effectiveness. Implications for the measurement and understanding of

AB Objectives: The goals of the current research were to determine: (1)
   whether there is a relationship between perceived social support and

   predicts hearing aid satisfaction relative to other correlates
   previously identified in the literature.
   Design: In study 1, 173 adult age = 68.9 years; SD = 13.4) users of
   hearing aids completed a survey assessing attitudes toward health,
   hearing, and hearing aids, as well as a questionnaire assessing Big-Five
   personality factors (Openness to Experience, Conscientiousness,
   Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism) either using paper and
   pencil or the Internet. In a follow-up study designed to replicate and
   extend the results from study 1, 161 adult age = 32.8 years; SD = 13.3)
   users of hearing aids completed a similar survey on the Internet. In
   study 2, participants also completed a measure of hearing aid benefit
   and reported the style of their hearing aid.
   Results: In studies 1 and 2, perceived social support was significantly
   correlated with hearing aid satisfaction (respectively, r = 0.34, r =
   0.51, ps < 0.001). The results of a regression analysis revealed that in
   study 1, 22% of the variance in hearing aid satisfaction scores was
   predicted by perceived social support, satisfaction with one's hearing
   health care provider, duration of daily hearing aid use, and openness.
   In study 2, 43% of the variance in hearing aid satisfaction was
   predicted by perceived social support, hearing aid benefit, neuroticism,
   and hearing aid style. Overall, perceived social support was the best
   predictor of hearing aid satisfaction in both studies. After controlling
   for response style (i.e., acquiescence or the tendency to respond
   positively), the correlation between perceived social support and
   hearing aid satisfaction remained the same in study 1 (r = 0.34, p <
   0.001) and was lower in study 2 (r = 0.39, p < 0.001), although the
   change in correlation was not significant.
   Conclusions: The results from study 1 provide evidence to suggest that
   perceived social support is a significant predictor of satisfaction with
   hearing aids, a finding that was replicated in a different sample of
   participants investigated in study 2. A significant relationship between
   perceived social support and hearing aid satisfaction was observed in
   both studies, even though the composition of the two samples differed in
   terms of age, relationship status, income, proportion of individuals
   with unilateral versus bilateral hearing impairment, and lifetime
   experience with hearing aids. The results from both studies 1 and 2
   provide no support for the claim that participant response style
   accounts for the relationship between hearing aid satisfaction and
   perceived social support.

AB Hypocrisy occurs when people fail to practice what they preach. Four
   experiments document the hypocrisy-by-association effect, whereby
   failing to practice what an organization preaches can make an employee
   seem hypocritical and invite moral condemnation. Participants judged
   employees more harshly for the same transgression when it was
   inconsistent with ethical values the employees' organization promoted,
   and ascriptions of hypocrisy mediated this effect (Studies 1-3). The
   results did not support the possibility that inconsistent transgressions
   simply seemed more harmful. In Study 4, participants were less likely to
   select a job candidate whose transgression did (vs. did not) contradict
   a value promoted by an organization where he had once interned. The
   results suggest that employees are seen as morally obligated to uphold
   the values that their organization promotes, even by people outside of
   the organization. We discuss how observers will judge someone against
   different ethical standards depending on where she or he works. (C) 2015

AB Introduction Social media are widely used by the general public and by
   public health and health care professionals. Emerging evidence suggests
   engagement with public health information on social media may influence
   health behavior. However, the volume of data accumulating daily on
   Twitter and other social media is a challenge for researchers with
   limited resources to further examine how social media influence health.
   To address this challenge, we used crowd-sourcing to facilitate the
   examination of topics associated with engagement with diabetes
   information on Twitter.
   Methods We took a random sample of 100 tweets that included the hashtag
   "#diabetes" from each day during a constructed week in May and June
   2014. Crowdsourcing through Amazon's Mechanical Turk platform was used
   to classify tweets into 9 topic categories and their senders into 3
   Twitter user categories. Descriptive statistics and Tweedie regression
   were used to identify tweet and Twitter user characteristics associated
   with 2 measures of engagement, "favoriting" and "retweeting."
   Results Classification was reliable for tweet topics and Twitter user
   type. The most common tweet topics were medical and nonmedical resources
   for diabetes. Tweets that included information about diabetes- related
   health problems were positively and significantly associated with
   engagement. Tweets about diabetes prevalence, nonmedical resources for
   diabetes, and jokes or sarcasm about diabetes were significantly
   negatively associated with engagement.
   Conclusion Crowdsourcing is a reliable, quick, and economical option for
   classifying tweets. Public health practitioners aiming to engage
   constituents around diabetes may want to focus on topics positively
   associated with engagement.

   Self and Perceived-partner versions of the AIRS, along with a number of

   validation sample, as well as a holdout sample of romantically involved
   college students (N = 112). Multi-group path analysis provided

   Consistent with prior experimental work, the Perceived-partner AIRS-SF

AB Scholars have long conceptualized public support for war as the product
   of a cost-benefit calculation in which combat casualties factor
   significantly. This article argues that, when calculating the human
   costs of conflict, Americans care about more than just the number of war
   dead; they also care about the distribution of those casualties across
   society. Using two original survey experiments, we show that
   inequalities in sacrifice affect Americans' casualty sensitivity. We
   find strong evidence that learning about socioeconomic inequalities in
   casualties in previous wars decreases Americans' casualty tolerance
   toward future military endeavors. These effects are stronger for some
   mission types, particularly non-humanitarian interventions, than others.
   The effects are also concentrated among Americans from states that
   suffered high casualty rates in the Iraq War. Our results suggest that
   raising public awareness of inequalities in wartime sacrifice could
   significantly strengthen popular constraints on policy makers
   contemplating military solutions to future crises.

   investigated the concept of martyrdom by creating a new tool to

   unidimensionality, internal consistency, and temporal stability while
   examining its nomological network. Studies 2A-2B focused on the scale's

   self-sacrifice on automatic decision making, costly and altruistic
   behaviors, and morality judgments. Results involving more than 2,900
   participants from different populations, including a terrorist sample,
   supported the proposed conceptualization of martyrdom and demonstrated

AB This article develops and tests a theory to explain the common tendency
   to "denigrate heroes," whereby high-status actors are suspected of being
   inconsiderate and inauthentic relative to low-status counterparts. This
   tendency is argued to reflect two conditions typical of status
   attainment processes: (a) assertions of superiority over others and (b)
   the presence of incentives to pursue status. The latter is key since
   awareness of such incentives breeds suspicions of inauthenticity, which
   in turn undermine perceptions of prosocial intentions. This theory is
   validated in a series of online experiments, in which categorical status
   hierarchies emerge either via deference on a coordinated task or via
   competitive interactions. Results show that high-status actors may also
   be " celebrated" as authentic and considerate when the observable
   incentive structure is such that assertions of superiority appear as
   unintended by-products of prosocial action. Implications are drawn
   regarding the sources of instability and insecurity in status
   hierarchies.

   of expertise, selecting a target domain of real-world perceptual
   expertise, recruiting experts, evaluating their level of expertise, and
   experimentally testing experts in the lab and online. Throughout our

AB In this study, the authors focused on the context of physical
   disabilities (i.e., one's age when a disability manifests and the
   severity with which it impacts major life activities) to better
   understand how disabilities influence vocational self-efficacies.
   Consistent with Social Cognitive Career Theory, age of onset moderated
   the relationship between disability severity and self-efficacies in the
   Realistic, Artistic, Social, and Conventional vocational domains.
   Specifically, disability severity had a strong, negative impact on
   self-efficacies for people who became physically disabled later in life.
   In contrast, the relationship between disability severity and
   self-efficacy was nonsignificant for people who became disabled in early
   childhood. These findings held across Holland's Realistic,
   Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising, and Conventional domains
   when controlling for a variety of other person inputs and
   domain-specific learning experiences.

AB The purpose of this study was to advance learner control as a
   psychological construct by reexamining its dimensionality and effects on
   learning and reactions in the context of technology-delivered training.
   Learners (n=384) completed a 2-h web-based Microsoft Excel training. The
   amount of instructional and scheduling control was manipulated in order
   to introduce variance in control perceptions. Outcome measures included
   off-task attention, declarative knowledge, and training reactions.
   Learner control is a multidimensional construct with differential
   effects on training outcomes. By focusing on learners' perceptions of
   control, we found that instructional control perceptions decreased
   learning by increasing off-task attention, while scheduling control
   perceptions increased learning.
   Though both dimensions of perceived learner control are positively
   related to training reactions, they differentially predict learning.
   Combined with factor analytic evidence, our study suggests that learner
   control research should differentiate between objective and perceived
   learner control, and between instructional and scheduling control
   perceptions. Organizations should consider how learner control affects
   learning prior to designing training.
   Scheduling control is an often used but rarely researched form of
   learner control. We address this gap by expanding the construct domain
   of learner control to include scheduling control. Further, this study
   provides the first empirical examination of learner control perceptions.
   Despite calls for learner control literature to differentiate between
   objective and perceived control, no study had previously examined
   control perceptions directly. Our results may be used to inform
   organizational decisions regarding the amount and type of control
   included in training.

AB Research on the effects of expressive writing about emotional
   experiences and traumatic events has a long history in the affective and
   social sciences. However, very little is known about the incidence and
   impact of affective states when the writing activities are not
   explicitly emotional or are less emotionally charged. By integrating
   goal-appraisal and network theories of affect within cognitive process
   models of writing, we hypothesize that writing triggers a host of
   affective states, some of which are tied to the topic of the essays
   (topic affective states), while others are more closely related to the
   cognitive processes involved in writing (process affective states). We
   tested this hypothesis with two experiments involving fine-grained
   tracking of affect while participants wrote short essays on topics that
   varied in emotional intensity including topics used in standardized
   tests, to socially charged issues, and personal emotional experiences.
   The results indicated that (a) affect collectively accounted for a
   majority of the observations compared to neutral, (b) boredom,
   engagement/flow, anxiety, frustration, and happiness were most frequent
   affective states, (c) there was evidence for a proposed, but not
   mutually exclusive, distinction between process and topic affective
   states, (d) certain topic affective states were predictive of the
   quality of the essays, irrespective of the valence of these states, and
   (e) individual differences in scholastic aptitude, writing apprehension,
   and exposure to print correlated with affect frequency in expected
   directions. Implications of our findings for research focused on
   monitoring affect during everyday writing activities are discussed.

AB People often try to improve their interpersonal skills to satisfy
   romantic partners. However, when and why a partner appreciates these
   efforts is an important but underaddressed question. The present
   research explored how people's theories that interpersonal abilities are
   either fixed entities or can be changed incrementally affect their
   responses to relationship partner's efforts at self-improvement. Study 1
   validated a new measure for these theories and showed that, compared to
   the former entity theorists, the latter incremental theorists were less
   likely to attribute recalled instances of partners' negative behaviors
   to dispositional causes and perceive these behaviors as fixed and
   stable. An experiment that induced these different implicit theories
   (Study 2) and a longitudinal study (Study 3) further demonstrated that
   perceptions of partners' self-improvement efforts led to greater
   increases in relationship security and quality among incremental than
   among entity theorists. How implicit theories may shape the
   interpersonal dynamics of self-improvement is discussed.

AB Displaying markers of coalitional affiliation is a common feature of
   contemporary life. In situations in which interaction with members of
   rival coalitions is likely, signaling coalitional affiliation may
   simultaneously constitute an implicit challenge to opponents and an
   objective commitment device, binding signalers to their coalitions.
   Individuals who invite conflict, and who cannot readily back out of
   conflict, constitute a greater threat than those who avoid conflict and
   preserve the option of feigning neutrality. As a consequence, the former
   should be viewed as more formidable than the latter. Recent research
   indicates that relative formidability is summarized using the envisioned
   physical size and strength of a potential antagonist. Thus, individuals
   who display markers of coalitional affiliation should be conceptualized
   as more physically imposing than those who do not. We tested this
   prediction in two experiments. In Study 1, conducted with U.S.
   university students, participants inspected images of sports fans'
   faces. In Study 2, conducted with U.S. Mechanical Turk workers,
   participants read vignettes depicting political partisans. In both
   studies, participants estimated the physical formidability of the target
   individuals and reported their own ability to defend themselves; in
   Study 2, participants estimated the target's aggressiveness. Consonant
   with predictions, targets depicted as signaling coalitional affiliation
   in situations of potential conflict were envisioned to be more
   physically formidable and more aggressive than were those not depicted
   as signaling thusly. Underscoring that the calculations at issue concern
   the possibility of violent conflict, participants' estimates of the
   protagonist's features were inversely correlated with their ability to
   defend themselves. Aggr. Behav. 42:299-309, 2016. (c) 2016 Wiley

AB Introduction: Research on vested interest theory (VIT) indicates that
   the importance and hedonic relevance of attitudes moderates the link
   between attitudes and attitude-congruent behavior. Though largely
   untested in prevention research, this relationship may prove crucial in
   determining the success or failure of prevention efforts. The current
   study was designed to determine if subjectively perceived vested
   interest maximized the association between attitudes and intentions
   regarding the nonmedical use of prescription stimulants (NUPS).
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted with college student
   respondents (N = 162) using Amazon's MTurk. Participant age ranged from
   19 to 49 years old. A subsample analysis (n = 129) was also conducted
   with younger respondents, as the typical college student is usually
   under the age of 30.
   Results: Four-step hierarchical regression analysis indicated that both
   attitudes and perceived vested interest were significantly associated
   with NUPS behavioral intentions (p <.001). Further, vested interest
   moderated the relationship between stimulant-related attitudes and usage
   intentions (p <.001). Attitudes were significantly associated with
   intentions of moderately and highly vested respondents (p <.001), but
   not those of participants expressing low levels of perceived vested
   interest.
   Conclusions: Findings support the proposition that vested interest may
   be a useful target for attenuating NUPS. Rather than attempting to
   weaken positive attitudes toward NUPS, campaigns may prove more
   successful if designed to convince receivers that NUPS is not in their
   best interest. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The wide variation in statutory rape and consent laws across states
   demonstrates a lack of consensus regarding adolescents' competency to
   make sexual decisions. This study investigated perceptions of

   samples: a sample of young adults and a sample of parents of teenagers.
   Younger partner age and partner age difference were varied across 15
   vignettes. Participants (N = 229) read each vignette, and then rated the
   younger partner's maturity and both partners' responsibility for the
   sexual relationship. Though young adults rated the younger partner as
   more mature and responsible than the parents did, both young adults and
   parents viewed adolescents as more able to consent and more responsible
   for sexual relationships as the age of the younger partner increased and
   partner age difference decreased. These results suggest that statutory
   rape and consent laws that consider factors such as partner age
   difference may be viewed more legitimately than those with strict ages
   of consent.

TI Countering the Plaintiff's Anchor: Jury Simulations to Evaluate Damages
   Arguments
SO IOWA LAW REVIEW
VL 101

BP 543
EP 571
PD JAN 2016
PY 2016
AB Numerous studies have shown that the amount of a juror's damages
   decision is strongly affected by the number suggested by the plaintiff's
   attorney, independent of the strength of the actual evidence (a
   psychological effect known as "anchoring"). For scholars and
   policymakers, this behavior is worrisome for the legitimacy and accuracy
   of jury decisions, especially in the domain of non-economic damages
   (e.g., pain and suffering). One noted paper even concluded that "the
   more you ask for, the more you get." Others believe that the damage
   demand must pass the "straight-face" test because outlandishly high
   demands will diminish credibility and risk the plaintiff losing
   outright.
   Can defendants effectively rebut an anchor? One strategy is for
   defendants to offer a "counter-anchor"-a much lower proposed damage
   award than the plaintiff's. However, defense attorneys worry that juries
   may interpret such a strategy as a concession of liability. Based on
   this fear, some defendants allow the plaintiff's anchor to go
   unrebutted. But this strategy, like counter-anchors, has not been
   rigorously studied.
   To answer these questions, we conducted a randomized controlled
   experiment in which we exposed mock jurors to a shortened medical
   malpractice trial, manipulated with six different sets of damages
   arguments in factorial design.
   The plaintiff demanded either $250,000 or $5 million non-economic
   damages. The defendant responded in one of three ways: (I) offering the
   counter-anchor that, if any damages are awarded, they should only be
   $50,000; (2) ignoring the plaintiff's damage demand; or (3) attacking
   the plaintiff's demand as outrageous. Mock jurors were then asked to
   render a decision on both liability and damages. These individual
   jurors' results were then combined with eleven other randomly selected
   jurors' decisions to create a mock "jury" decision.
   Our study confirmed that anchoring has a powerful effect on damages, and
   a small negative effect on liability determinations. However, for the
   expected value of the case the average award when both liability and
   damage award are considered these "credibility effects" were overwhelmed
   by anchoring effects. Our study also revealed that high anchors are
   difficult to counter. Although we found some variation in the efficacy
   of defense strategies when plaintiffs anchored low, none of these
   strategies were an effective antidote to the plaintiffs' high anchor.
   Additionally, and contrary to conventional belief, the defendant's
   choice to offer a lower counter-anchor award did not adversely affect
   liability determinations. This result challenges concerns that such
   tactics effectively "concede" liability. These findings have important
   implications for policy and litigation strategy.

AB Crowdsourcing platforms provide an affordable approach for recruiting
   large and diverse samples in a short time. Past research has shown that
   researchers can obtain reliable data from these sources, at least in
   domains of research that are not affectively involving. The goal of the
   present study was to test if crowdsourcing platforms can also be used to
   conduct experiments that incorporate the induction of aversive affective
   states. First, a laboratory experiment with German university students
   was conducted in which a frustrating task induced anger and aggressive
   behavior. This experiment was then replicated online using five
   crowdsourcing samples. The results suggest that participants in the
   online samples reacted very similarly to the anger manipulation as
   participants in the laboratory experiments. However, effect sizes were
   smaller in crowdsourcing samples with non-German participants while a
   crowdsourcing sample with exclusively German participants yielded
   virtually the same effect size as in the laboratory.

AB In the United States, the phrase nation of immigrants is used to both
   promote and restrict immigration. Those who use the phrase to promote
   immigration point to the similarities between current and previous
   generations of immigrants, whereas those who use it to restrict
   immigration emphasize the differences between the two generations. The
   present study examined the effects of the different versions of this
   historical narrative (similarity-focused vs. difference-focused) on 210
   U.S. residents' attitudes toward immigrants during the recent debate
   about immigration reform. Exposure to the similarity-focused nation of
   immigrants reduced perceptions of threat from Mexican immigrants but did
   not affect the already low level of perceived threat from Russian
   immigrants. The similarity-focused version of nation of immigrants
   exerted an indirect effect on perceived threat from both groups by
   inducing a sense of identity continuity, which reduced collective angst
   about the future of the people of the United States. The findings
   suggest that pro-immigration policy makers clearly articulate the
   meaning of nation of immigrants rather than use it as a cliche as the
   phrase has the potential to induce inclusive attitudes.

AB Self-compassion is posited to protect against posttraumatic stress

   changed these relations. The current study examined the relation between
   self-compassion and PTSD symptoms using DSM IV and DSM 5 criteria. PTSD
   symptoms and self-compassion were evaluated in two trauma-exposed
   samples using measures that corresponded to DSM IV and DSM 5 criteria.
   Self-compassion was negatively correlated with aggregated PTSD symptoms
   for DSM IV and DSM 5. Self-compassion was correlated with avoidance
   symptoms for DSM IV but was correlated with all symptom clusters for the

   more comprehensive assessment of adverse childhood experiences to extend
   prior literature by examining if MH individuals' experience of
   victimization more closely mirrors that of sexual minority individuals
   or heterosexuals. Heterosexual (n = 422) and LGB (n = 561) and MH (n =
   120) participants were recruited online. Respondents completed surveys
   about their adverse childhood experiences, both maltreatment by adults
   (e.g., childhood physical, emotional, and sexual abuse and childhood
   household dysfunction) and peer victimization (i.e., verbal and physical
   bullying). Specifically, MH individuals were 1.47 times more likely than
   heterosexuals to report childhood victimization experiences perpetrated
   by adults. These elevated rates were similar to LGB individuals. Results
   suggest that rates of victimization of MH groups are more similar to the
   rates found among LGBs, and are significantly higher than heterosexual
   groups. Our results support prior research that indicates that an MH
   identity falls within the umbrella of a sexual minority, yet little is
   known about unique challenges that this group may face in comparison to
   other sexual minority groups.

AB Pain captures attention, displaces current concerns, and prioritises
   escape and repair. This attentional capture can be measured by its
   effects on general cognition. Studies on induced pain, naturally
   occurring acute pain, and chronic pain all demonstrate a detrimental
   effect on specific tasks of attention, especially those that involve
   working memory. However, studies to date have relied on relatively small
   samples and/or one type of pain, thus restricting our ability to
   generalise to wider populations. We investigated the effect of pain on
   an n-back task in a large heterogeneous sample of 1318 adults.
   Participants were recruited from the general population and tested
   through the internet. Despite the heterogeneity of pain conditions,
   participant characteristics, and testing environments, we found a
   performance decrement on the n-back task for those with pain, compared
   with those without pain; there were significantly more false alarms on
   nontarget trials. Furthermore, we also found an effect of pain
   intensity; performance was poorer in participants with higher intensity
   compared with that in those with lower intensity pain. We suggest that
   the effects of pain on attention found in the laboratory occur in more
   naturalistic settings. Pain is common in the general population, and
   such interruption may have important, as yet uninvestigated,
   consequences for tasks of everyday cognition that involve working
   memory, such as concentration, reasoning, motor planning, and
   prospective memory.

   participants (age: M = 31.50 SD = 10.27, 667 males and 333 females),
   recruited through Amazons' Mechanical Turk (MTurk), responded to the

   Individuals with a high affective profile reported higher degree of

   individuals with a self-destructive profile, also higher degree of
   Machiavellianism and psychopathy than individuals with a low affective
   and self-fulfilling profile. Males scored higher in Machiavellianism and
   psychopathy. Together with earlier findings, our results show that while
   individuals in both the self-fulfilling and high affective profiles are
   extrovert and self-directed, only those in the high affective profile
   express an immature and malevolent character (i.e., high levels of all
   Dark Triad traits). Conversely, individuals in the self-fulfilling
   profile have earlier reported higher levels of cooperativeness and
   faith. More importantly, the unique association between high levels of
   positive emotions and narcissism and the unified association between
   negative emotions to both psychopathy and Machiavellianism imply a dyad
   rather than a triad of malevolent character traits.

AB Objective: Critiques of self-report indices of emotion regulation
   suggest that its measurement is in need of more critical investigation.
   The current study examined the factor structure of emotion regulation as
   informed by Gross' (1998a) Process Model: Situation Selection,
   Attentional Deployment, Cognitive Change, and Response Modulation.
   Method: A sample of 553 participants was recruited using Amazon's
   Mechanical Turk (M-age = 37.12, SD = 13.66; n = 352 female).
   Confirmatory factor analysis with maximum likelihood estimation was
   performed in Mplus. Results: A four-factor model of emotion regulation
   demonstrated poor fit. An alternative five-factor model fit the data
   well: CFI = .94, TLI = .93, RMSEA = .07. Conclusion: Emotion regulation
   may be better conceptualized as a combination of specific strategy use
   and a broader construct, called "emotional distancing" (a trait-like

AB Rationale: Investigations conducted through Amazon's Mechanical Turk
   (MTurk) sometimes explicitly note eligibility requirements when
   recruiting participants; however, the impact of this practice on data
   integrity is relatively unexplored within the MTurk context.
   Objective: Contextualized in the organ donor registration domain, the
   current study assessed whether overtly listing eligibility requirements
   impairs the accuracy of data collected on MTurk.
   Methods: On day 1, the first and third round of data collection did not
   list eligibility requirements; the second and fourth round overtly
   listed a qualification requirement: status as a non-registered organ
   donor. On day 2, the approach was identical, except the order was
   reversed the first and third round overtly listed the study
   qualifications, while the second and fourth did not. These procedures
   provided eight different waves of data. In addition, all participants
   were randomly assigned to read an elevating (i.e., morally inspiring)
   story or a story not intended to elicit any emotion. Regardless of
   recruitment approach, only participants who were not registered as
   donors were included in the analysis.
   Results: Results indicated that the recruitment script that explicitly
   requested non-registered donors resulted in the collection of
   participants with higher mean intentions scores than the script that did
   not overtly list the eligibility requirements. Further, even though the
   elevation induction increased intentions to register as a donor, there
   was not a significant interaction between recruitment approach and the
   influence of the elevation manipulation on registration intentions.
   Conclusion: Explicitly listing eligibility requirements can influence
   the accuracy of estimates derived from data collected through MTurk. (C)

AB When people rapidly judge the truth of claims presented with or without
   related but nonprobative photos, the photos tend to inflate the
   subjective truth of those claims-a "truthiness" effect (Newman et al.,
   2012). For example, people more often judged the claim "Macadamia nuts
   are in the same evolutionary family as peaches" to be true when the
   claim appeared with a photo of a bowl of macadamia nuts than when it
   appeared alone. We report several replications of that effect and 3
   qualitatively new findings: (a) in a within-subjects design, when people
   judged claims paired with a mix of related, unrelated, or no photos,
   related photos produced truthiness but unrelated photos had no
   significant effect relative to no photos; (b) in a mixed design, when
   people judged claims paired with related (or unrelated) and no photos,
   related photos produced truthiness and unrelated photos produced
   "falseness;" and (c) in a fully between design, when people judged
   claims paired with either related, unrelated, or no photos, neither
   truthiness nor falsiness occurred. Our results suggest that photos
   influence people's judgments when a discrepancy arises in the expected
   ease of processing, and also support a mechanism in which-against a
   backdrop of an expected standard-related photos help people generate
   pseudoevidence to support claims.

AB Background: Whereas prior work has established fear and distress
   clusters underlying unipolar mood and anxiety disorders, the optimal
   placement of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) within this model is
   unclear. One likely contributor to this ambiguity is the heterogeneous
   nature of OCD. There is increasing evidence for distinct symptom
   dimensions that are more homogenous than the broad OCD phenotype. Using
   structural equation modeling, the current study examined the relations
   between various OCD symptom dimensions and symptoms associated with
   fear/distress disorders.
   Methods: Participants included 526 individuals recruited from an online
   crowdsourcing marketplace.
   Results: Results revealed that the symmetry obsessions/arranging
   compulsions, harm obsessions/checking compulsions, and unacceptable
   thoughts/neutralizing compulsions were related to both fear and distress
   disorder symptoms, whereas the contamination obsessions/washing
   compulsions dimension of OCD was specifically related to fear disorder
   symptoms.
   Limitations: Limitations include the use of self-report questionnaires
   to measure all constructs of interest.
   Conclusions: These findings add to a growing body of literature
   attesting to the multidimensional nature of OCD and progress our
   understanding of the etiological underpinnings of this severe and
   debilitating condition. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved

   differing in social network user experiences, motivations and frequency
   of social network also differed in self-reported QOL. Two-hundred and
   thirty-seven individuals (aged 1865) were recruited online using the
   online platform Mechanical Turk (MTurk). All participants completed a
   web-based survey examining social network use and the World Health
   Organization Quality of Life Scale Abbreviated Version (WHOQOL-Bref) to
   assess QOL. Individuals who reported positive associations with the use
   of social networks demonstrated higher QOL while those reporting
   negative associates demonstrated lower QOL. Moreover, individuals using
   social networks to stay connected to friends demonstrated higher QOL
   while those using social networking for dating purposes reported lower
   QOL Frequency of social network use did not relate to QOL. These results
   suggest that QOL differs among social network users. Thus, participating
   in social networking may be a way to either promote or detract from QOL.

AB Objective
   Modification and prevention of risky sexual behavior is important to
   individuals' health and public health policy. This study employed a
   novel sexual discounting task to elucidate the effects of social
   learning and regret expression on delay to sexual gratification in a
   behavioral task.
   Methods
   Amazon Mechanical Turk Workers were assigned to hear one of three
   scenarios about a friend who engages in similar sexual behavior. The
   scenarios included a positive health consequence, a negative health
   consequence or a negative health consequence with the expression of
   regret. After reading one scenario, participants were asked to select
   from 60 images, those with whom they would have casual sex. Of the
   selected images, participants chose one image each for the person they
   most and least want to have sex with and person most and least likely to
   have a sexually transmitted infection. They then answered questions
   about engaging in unprotected sex now or waiting some delay for
   condom-protected sex in each partner condition.
   Results
   Results indicate that the negative health outcome scenario with regret
   expression resulted in delayed sexual gratification in the most
   attractive and least STI partner conditions, whereas in the least
   attractive and most STI partner conditions the negative health outcome
   with and without regret resulted in delayed sexual gratification.
   Conclusions
   Results suggest that the sexual discounting task is a relevant
   laboratory measure and the framing of information to include regret
   expression may be relevant for prevention of risky sexual behavior.

   on the valence of leaders' displayed emotion and on followers' affective
   reactions to those displays. In contrast, we examined followers'
   cognitive reactions to the perceived sincerity of leaders' displayed

   related to their perceptions of that leader's emotional sincerity. Study
   2 replicated these results among Chinese workers, and further indicated
   the mechanisms through which perceived emotional sincerity influenced
   trust and showed how trust influenced performance. The findings
   demonstrate the importance of including emotional sincerity in studies
   of leader affect, and suggest the value of adding a cognitive

AB Newcomers to a social network show preferential attachment, a tendency
   to befriend those with many friends. Here, we show that preferential
   attachment is equivalent to a form of 'probability matching' commonly
   found in studies of decision-making. This equivalence, whereby newcomers
   probability match to a social signal akin to popularity, marries network
   science to the study of decision-making and raises new questions about
   how individual psychology impacts the social structure of groups. We
   asked people to view a visualization of a social network and to select
   group members whom they would like to meet and befriend. People varied
   in how strongly they weighed popularity and this was mildly correlated
   with aspects of their personality. Individual differences in
   preferential attachment affect the structure and connectivity of the
   network that emerges.

AB Though the decision to behave immorally is situated within the context
   of prior immoral behavior, research has provided contradictory insights
   into this process. In a series of experiments, we demonstrate that the
   effects of prior immoral behavior depend on how individuals think about,
   or reflect on, their immoral behavior. In Experiment 1, participants who
   reflected counterfactually on their prior moral lapses morally
   disengaged (i.e., rationalized) less than participants who reflected
   factually. In Experiment 2, participants who reflected counterfactually
   on their prior moral lapses experienced more guilt than those who
   reflected factually. Finally, in Experiments 3 and 4, participants who
   reflected counterfactually lied less on unrelated tasks with real
   monetary stakes than those who reflected factually. Our studies provide
   important insights into moral rationalization and moral compensation
   processes and demonstrate the profound influence of reflection in

AB Four experiments examined whether information implying imminent threat
   to safety would interact with regulatory focus (Higgins, 1997) to affect
   the utilization of threat-relevant stereotypes. Because information
   suggesting imminent danger is more relevant to the safety goals of
   prevention-focused individuals than the advancement goals of
   promotion-focused individuals, utilization of threat-relevant
   stereotypes was expected to increase under such conditions only under
   prevention focus. Support for this prediction was obtained in four
   distinct and socially important domains. Using scenarios describing a
   violent crime committed by an African-American male (Experiment 1) or a
   petty crime committed by an undocumented immigrant (Experiment 2),
   prevention-focused individuals made judgments consistent with
   stereotypes when threat was perceived to be high rather than low. In
   studies that manipulated the stereotypicality of the target in a
   terrorism scenario (Experiments 3 & 4), prevention-focused individuals
   were more likely to endorse scrutinizing a stereotypical compared with a
   non-stereotypical target when terrorism was described as an increasing
   problem. Implications for models of stereotyping, self-regulation, and
   responding to threat are discussed. (c) 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Background: In recent years, people who sought direct-to-consumer
   genetic testing services have been increasingly confronted with an
   unprecedented amount of personal genomic information, which influences
   their decisions, emotional state, and well-being. However, these users
   of direct-to-consumer genetic services, who vary in their education and
   interests, frequently have little relevant experience or tools for
   understanding, reasoning about, and interacting with their personal
   genomic data. Online interactive techniques can play a central role in
   making personal genomic data useful for these users.
   Objective: We sought to (1) identify the needs of diverse users as they
   make sense of their personal genomic data, (2) consequently develop
   effective interactive visualizations of genomic trait data to address
   these users' needs, and (3) evaluate the effectiveness of the developed
   visualizations in facilitating comprehension.
   Methods: The first two user studies, conducted with 63 volunteers in the
   Personal Genome Project and with 36 personal genomic users who
   participated in a design workshop, respectively, employed surveys and
   interviews to identify the needs and expectations of diverse users.
   Building on the two initial studies, the third study was conducted with
   730 Amazon Mechanical Turk users and employed a controlled experimental
   design to examine the effectiveness of different design interventions on
   user comprehension.
   Results: The first two studies identified searching, comparing, sharing,
   and organizing data as fundamental to users' understanding of personal
   genomic data. The third study demonstrated that interactive and visual
   design interventions could improve the understandability of personal
   genomic reports for consumers. In particular, results showed that a new
   interactive bubble chart visualization designed for the study resulted
   in the highest comprehension scores, as well as the highest perceived
   comprehension scores. These scores were significantly higher than scores
   received using the industry standard tabular reports currently used for
   communicating personal genomic information.
   Conclusions: Drawing on multiple research methods and populations, the
   findings of the studies reported in this paper offer deep understanding
   of users' needs and practices, and demonstrate that interactive online
   design interventions can improve the understandability of personal
   genomic reports for consumers. We discuss implications for designers and
   researchers.

PY 2015
AB Since its inception, evidence policymakers have vacillated with respect
   to whether the rule barring hearsay evidence at trial is a doctrine
   designed to promote decisional accuracy or a doctrine designed to
   promote procedural justice.
   To the extent that policymakers view the rule barring hearsay evidence
   as promoting decisional accuracy, the rationale for this view stems from
   the "testimonial triangle" promulgated by Professor Laurence Tribe,
   which conceptualizes the objections to hearsay evidence at common law
   Tribe's testimonial triangle states that (1) several infirmities lurk
   behind all testimony provided in court, and (2) testimony based on
   hearsay is subject to two sets of infirmities-those of the in-court
   witness and those of the original declarant. With respect to hearsay
   evidence, policymakers fear that jurors do not attend appropriately to
   the infirmities of the original declarant who is not subject to in-court
   cross-examination and will give hearsay evidence undue weight.
   This Article reports the results of the first empirical examination of
   the testimonial triangle. The studies reported in this Article suggest
   that, consistent with behavioral science research on implicit goal
   activation and psychological distance, jurors are attuned to the
   testimonial infirmities that lurk beneath hearsay evidence and discount
   the evidence defensibly. These findings have important implications for
   the hearsay doctrine, for the contentious debate over juror competency,
   and for practicing attorneys who make decisions about hearsay evidence
   at trial. They also provide a theoretical framework for further
   empirical hearsay research and suggest that policymakers should focus
   their debate over the hearsay doctrine on the degree to which the
   doctrine promotes procedural justice, not decisional accuracy.

AB Despite the wealth of mental-health information available online to
   consumers, research has shown that the mental-health information needs
   of consumers are not being met. This study contributes to that research
   by soliciting consumer questions directly, categorizing them, analyzing
   their form, and assessing the extent to which they can be answered from
   a trusted and vetted source of online information, namely the website of
   the US National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). As an alternative to
   surveys and analyses of online activity, this study shows how consumer
   questions provide new insight into what consumers do not know and how
   they express their information needs. The study crowdsourced 100
   consumer questions through Amazon Inc.'s Mechanical Turk. Categorization
   of the questions shows broad agreement with earlier studies in terms of
   the content of consumer questions. It also suggests that consumers'
   grasp of mental health issues may be low compared to other health
   topics. The majority of the questions (74%) were simple in form, with
   the remainder being multi-part, multifaceted or narrative. Even
   simple-form questions could, however, have complex interpretations.
   Fifty four questions were submitted to the search box at the NIMH
   website. For 32 questions, no answer could be found in the top one to
   three documents returned. Inadequacies in the search and retrieval
   technology deployed at websites account for some of the failure to find
   answers. The nature of consumer questions in mental health also plays a
   role. A question that has a false presupposition is less likely to have
   an answer in trusted and vetted sources of information. Consumer
   questions are also expressed with a degree of specificity that makes the
   retrieval of relevant information difficult. The significance of this
   study is that it shows what an analysis of consumer mental-health
   questions can tell us about consumer information needs and it provides
   new insight into the difficulties facing consumers looking for answers
   to their questions in online resources.

AB Aims: The use of fear appeals with disgusting graphical content is part
   of current practice in health campaigns. Previous studies have suggested
   both a detrimental and a beneficial effect of disgust in fear appeals on
   different types of outcome measures. We were interested in whether
   disgust in anti-smoking messages decreases or increases persuasion as
   measured by motivation to abstain from smoking and attitudes towards
   smoking. Methods: In two online experiments (total N = 1045), smokers
   (26%) and non-smokers were randomly assigned to watch fear appeal
   anti-smoking ads that elicited high versus moderate levels of disgust
   but similar levels of fear. Smokers reported motivation to quit, while
   non-smokers reported motivation to not start smoking. All participants
   reported explicit attitudes toward smoking and performed an Implicit
   Association Test that measures implicit attitudes toward smoking and
   cigarettes. Findings: There were no differences between these
   conditions, except on a measure of implicit attitudes. However, this
   effect was not replicated in the second study, and analyses across
   studies revealed no substantial difference between the conditions.
   Conclusions: In the current context, there were no or potentially very
   small benefits of using disgust elements when level of fear was held
   constant (i.e. compared to other means of inducing negative emotions).

   likely to accept responsibility for a transgression? We examined how
   implicit theories of personalitywhether people see personality as
   malleable (incremental theory) or fixed (entity theory)influence
   transgressors' likelihood of accepting responsibility. We argue that
   incremental theorists may feel less threatened by accepting
   responsibility because they are more likely to view the situation as an
   opportunity for them to grow as a person and develop their relationship
   with the victim. We found support for our predictions across four
   studies using a combination of real-world and hypothetical offenses, and
   correlational and experimental methods. These studies therefore identify
   an important individual difference factor that can lead to more
   effective responses from transgressors.

AB Current computational models of theory of mind typically assume that
   humans believe each other to selfishly maximize utility, for a
   conception of utility that makes it indistinguishable from personal
   gains. We argue that this conception is at odds with established facts
   about human altruism, as well as the altruism that humans expect from
   each other. We report two experiments showing that people expect other
   agents to selfishly maximize their pleasure, even when these other
   agents behave altruistically. Accordingly, defining utility as pleasure
   permits us to reconcile the assumption that humans expect each other to
   selfishly maximize utility with the fact that humans expect each other
   to behave altruistically.

AB Crowdtesting is increasingly popular among researchers to carry out
   subjective assessments of different services. Experimenters can easily
   assess to a huge pool of :human subjects through crowdsourcing
   platforms. The workers are usually anonymous, and they participate in
   the experiments independently. Therefore, a fundamental problem
   threatening the integrity of these platforms is to detect various types
   of cheating from the workers.
   In this poster, we propose cheat-detection mechanism based on an
   analysis of the workers' mouse cursor trajectories. It provides a
   jQuery-based library to record browser events. We compute a set of
   metrics from the cursor traces to identify cheaters. We deploy our
   mechanism to the survey pages for our video quality assessment tasks
   published on Amazon Mechanical Turk. Our results show that cheaters'
   cursor movement is usually more direct and contains less pauses.

AB Coherence relations differ in their tendency to be explicitly marked.
   How such relations are recognized and what determines their tendency to
   be marked is a matter of debate. The connective so represents a special
   case: it can be used to signal RESULT coherence relations and the more
   specific cause-effect relation of PURPOSE, but overt marking has been
   claimed to be required for PURPOSE and optional for RESULT. We present
   written corpus and experimental results on the use of so that show that
   RESULT and PURPOSE with this connective can be reliably distinguished
   from each other, and that the modal auxiliaries can/could and will/would
   are strongly associated with PURPOSE. In the corpus study, PURPOSE
   always occurs with explicit so, while RESULT is often left unmarked.
   These results are in line with recent claims based on annotated corpus
   data that implicit (unmarked) and explicit (marked) coherence relations
   can be qualitatively different (e.g. Sporleder and Lascarides, 2008;
   Webber, 2009). However, in our experiments using strongly purposive
   event pairs, 35-40% of examples were identified as PURPOSE without a
   connective or a modal verb cue. We argue that the difference between the
   corpus results and the experimental results can be explained as a
   difference between the tasks of speakers and hearers, and we outline an
   explanation for how marking can be obligatory for PURPOSE relations and
   yet optional for RESULT. We also propose that nonveridicality seems to
   play a key role in a marking requirement for PURPOSE, and explain why
   the unusual marking pattern found makes it difficult to give a pragmatic
   account similar to more well-known language asymmetries. (C) 2014

AB We propose a method for finding an appropriate setting of a
   pay-per-performance payment system to prevent participation of insincere
   workers in crowdsourcing. Crowdsourcing enables fast and low-cost
   accomplishment of tasks; however, insincere workers prevent the task
   requester from obtaining high-quality results. Instead of a fixed
   payment system, the pay-per-performance payment system is promising for
   excluding insincere workers. However, it is difficult to learn what
   settings are better, and a naive payment setting may cause
   unsatisfactory outcomes. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a
   method for calculating the expected payments for sincere and insincere
   workers, and then clarifying the conditions in the payment setting in
   which sincere workers are willing to choose a task, while insincere
   workers are not willing to choose the task. We evaluated the proposed
   method by conducting several experiments on tweet labeling tasks in
   Amazon Mechanical Turk. The results suggest that the pay-per-performance
   system is useful for preventing participation of insincere workers.

AB Three decades of research suggests that cognitive simulation of motion
   is involved in the comprehension of object location, bodily
   configuration, and linguistic meaning. For example, the remembered
   location of an object associated with actual or implied motion is
   typically displaced in the direction of motion. In this paper, two
   experiments explore context effects in spatial displacement. They
   provide a novel approach to estimating the remembered location of an
   implied motion image by employing a cursor-positioning task. Both
   experiments examine how the remembered spatial location of a person is
   influenced by subtle differences in implied motion, specifically, by
   shifting the orientation of the person's body to face upward or
   downward, and by pairing the image with motion language that differed on
   intentionality, fell versus jumped. The results of Experiment 1, a
   survey-based experiment, suggest that language and body orientation
   influenced vertical spatial displacement. Results of Experiment 2, a
   task that used Adobe Flash and Amazon Mechanical Turk, showed consistent
   effects of body orientation on vertical spatial displacement but no
   effect of language. Our findings are in line with previous work on
   spatial displacement that uses a cursor-positioning task with implied
   motion stimuli. We discuss how different ways of simulating motion can
   influence spatial memory.

AB Mass media convey deep divisions among citizens despite scant evidence
   for such ideological polarization. Do ordinary citizens perceive
   themselves to be more extreme and divided than they actually are? If so,
   what are the ramifications of such misperception? A representative
   sample from California provides evidence that voters from both sides of
   the state's political divide perceive both their liberal and
   conservative peers' positions as more extreme than they actually are,
   implying inaccurate beliefs about polarization. A second study again
   demonstrates this finding with an online sample and presents evidence
   that misperception of mass-level extremity can affect individuals' own
   policy opinions. Experimental participants randomly assigned to learn
   the actual average policy-related predispositions of liberal and
   conservative Americans later report opinions that are 8-13% more
   moderate, on average. Thus, citizens appear to consider peers' positions
   within public debate when forming their own opinions and adopt slightly
   more extreme positions as a consequence.

AB In many supervised learning problems, determining the true labels of
   training instances is expensive, laborious, and even practically
   impossible. As an alternative approach, it is much easier to collect
   multiple subjective (possibly noisy) labels from human labelers,
   especially with the crowdsourcing services such as Amazon's Mechanical
   Turk. The collected labels are then aggregated to estimate the true
   labels. In order to reduce the negative effects of novices, spammers,
   and malicious labelers, it necessitates taking into account the
   accuracies of the labelers. However, in the absence of true labels, we
   miss the main source of information to estimate the labeler accuracies.
   This paper demonstrates that the agreements or disagreements among
   labeler opinions are useful sources of information and facilitate the
   accuracy estimation problem. We represent this estimation problem as an
   optimization problem which its goal is to minimize the differences
   between the analytical probabilities of disagreements based on estimated
   accuracies and the probabilities of disagreements according to the
   provided labels. We present an efficient semi-exhaustive search method
   to solve this optimization problem. Our experiments on the simulated
   data and three real datasets show that the proposed method is a
   promising idea in this emerging new area. The source code of the
   proposed method is available for downloading at

AB In the present study, the self-control and recovery/detachment research
   literatures are integrated to explore the connection between workload
   and procrastination. We tested a conceptual model that draws heavily
   from the stressor-detachment model (Sonnentag, 2011), and represents one
   of the first empirical tests of this model. We hypothesized that
   psychological detachment would both mediate and moderate the
   relationship between workload and fatigue and that fatigue would mediate
   the relationship between psychological detachment and procrastination.
   We tested the hypothesized model by surveying 547 working adults at 3
   points in time over a 2-month period. Psychological detachment fully
   mediated the relationship between workload and fatigue; psychological
   detachment did not moderate this relationship. Fatigue partially
   mediated the relationship between psychological detachment and
   procrastination. Further, workload was indirectly related to
   procrastination 2 months later through relationships with psychological
   detachment and fatigue. These findings suggest that occupational
   stressors are related to procrastination and that this relationship can
   be partially explained by psychological detachment and fatigue.

TI Reducing the Barriers to Writing Verified Specifications
SO ACM SIGPLAN NOTICES
AB Formally verifying a program requires significant skill not only because of complex interactions between program sub-components, but also because of deficiencies in current verification interfaces. These skill barriers make verification economically unattractive by preventing the use of less-skilled (less-expensive) workers and distributed workflows (i.e., crowdsourcing).
   This paper presents VeriWeb, a web-based IDE for verification that decomposes the task of writing verifiable specifications into manageable subproblems. To overcome the information loss caused by task decomposition, and to reduce the skill required to verify a program, VeriWeb incorporates several innovative user interface features: drag and drop condition construction, concrete counterexamples, and specification inlining.
   To evaluate VeriWeb, we performed three experiments. First, we show that VeriWeb lowers the time and monetary cost of verification by performing a comparative study of VeriWeb and a traditional tool using 14 paid subjects contracted hourly from Exhedra Solution's vWorker online marketplace. Second, we demonstrate the dearth and insufficiency of current ad-hoc labor marketplaces for verification by recruiting workers from Amazon's Mechanical Turk to perform verification with VeriWeb. Finally, we characterize the minimal communication overhead incurred when VeriWeb is used collaboratively by observing two pairs of developers each use the tool simultaneously to verify a single program.
